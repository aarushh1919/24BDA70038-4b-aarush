The aim of this project is to develop a RESTful Card Collection API using Node.js and Express that allows users to efficiently create, read, update, delete, and paginate card records.

In simple words, the project is designed to:

Manage a collection of playing cards through HTTP endpoints

Provide CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Implement pagination for efficient data retrieval

Demonstrate a clean layered architecture (routes → controller → service → model)
